# Accuser

Accuser is a lightweight framework that lets you write Github bots that monitor Pull Requests and assign a person to the PR.

The framework wraps around the [node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github) library to make it easier to monitor pull requests, assign people and write comments.
